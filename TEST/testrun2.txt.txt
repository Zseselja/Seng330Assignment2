Failed
All tests in the same test case must use the same test fixture
class.  However, in test case mainTest_ship,
you defined test Ship and test Ship
using two different test fixture classes.  This can happen if
the two classes are from different namespaces or translation
units and have the same name.  You should probably rename one
of the classes to put the tests into different test cases.
